# A-novel-SVM-kNN-PSO-Ensemble-method-for-intrusion-detection-system- in python
# Highlights
1. IDS implemented using ensemble of a six SVM and a six k-NN classifier.
2. Ensembles are created with weight generated by PSO and meta-PSO algorithms.
3. These two ensembles outperform third ensemble system that is created with WMA.

In machine learning, a combination of classifiers, known as an ensemble classifier, often outperforms individual ones. While many ensemble approaches exist, it remains, however, a difficult task to find a suitable ensemble configuration for a particular dataset. This paper proposes a novel ensemble construction method that uses PSO generated weights to create ensemble of classifiers with better accuracy for intrusion detection. Local unimodal sampling (LUS) method is used as a meta-optimizer to find better behavioral parameters for PSO. For our empirical study, we took five random subsets from the well-known KDD99 dataset. Ensemble classifiers are created using the new approaches as well as the weighted majority algorithm (WMA) approach. Our experimental results suggest that the new approach can generate ensembles that outperform WMA in terms of classification accuracy.
